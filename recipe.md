First prepare the recipes as per the instructions on each individual blog post
When the cake layers are cooled, trim the tops *reserve the trimmings and then torte each cake so you have a total of 4 layers.
Reserve 8 of the Biscoff cookies for garnish then chop the rest of the package into medium-fine crumbs
Add half jar of cookie butter to the buttercream at the last stage of mixing, then divide that entire portion in half and add half package of the chopped cookies to half of the buttercream this will be the crunchy cookie butter cake filling
In a large mixing bowl combine leftover cake scraps ( I used vanilla cake from a previous project, but you can use the trimmed chocolate cake from this recipe instead) the other half of the cookie butter and the other half of the chopped cookies.
Mix until it is all uniform & evenly distributed then scoop into balls, roll the balls with your hands and then refrigerate while you melt your white & dark chocolates.
Coat the balls with the dark chocolate first and then plunge into the white chocolate for a swirled effect. Transfer to the parchment lined sheet pan to set.
Now build your cake as per the video tutorial, with the cookie butter crunch buttercream filling and cookie butter buttercream icing.
Once iced, pour the ganache drip around the edges and garnish with reserved cookies & cookie butter crunch balls

your crunchy cake is ready :)
